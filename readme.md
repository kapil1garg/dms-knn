k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) computes the distance between a new target instance to a set of labeled data. During distance calculation, categorical variables are converted to numeric values so both Eucledian Distance and Manhattan Distance can be calculated with ease.

Once distance to each other instance is computed, the nearest k instances are selected classification for the target is done by majority vote.
